This folder contains the package my_reactive_controller. This contains LIDAR alarm script that alerts the simulated robot when it is approaching an object. There is another script, the reactive_commander, which uses the signals from the LIDAR alarm to somewhat aimlessly traverse around the maze. Implementation details can be found in the README.md file within the package.
